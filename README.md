# Pentago

For those unfamiliar with the game Pentago, it is a 6x6 boardgame where each player is a different color and may select to place one of their pieces onto the board in any location. After placing their piece their turn is not over yet, they must rotate one of the four regions of the board 90 degrees in either direction.

The purpose of this program was to familiarize myself with 2d-arrays using Java.
